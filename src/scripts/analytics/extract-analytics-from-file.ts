/**
 * ------------ Overview ------------
 * 
 * This script processes a pricing file to extract analytics and logs the results.
 * 
 * The script uses the `pricing4ts` library to analyze a pricing model provided in the input file.
 * It logs both the analytics and any errors encountered during processing into a dedicated log folder
 * within the `logs` directory, timestamped to ensure unique entries for each run.
 * 
 * ------------ Features ------------
 * 
 * - Creates a timestamped log folder in the `logs` directory to organize results and errors.
 * - Reads and processes a pricing model file specified via a command-line argument.
 * - Uses the `PricingService` class from the `pricing4ts` library to calculate analytics for the pricing model.
 * - Logs the analytics into `results.log` and errors into `errors.log` within the log folder.
 * 
 * ------------ Parameters ------------
 * 
 * - **filePath**: The path to the pricing file to process. This is passed as the first argument when running the script.
 * 
 * ------------ How to Run ------------
 * 
 * 1. Install the required dependencies, including `pricing4ts`.
 * 2. Use the following command to execute the script:
 * 
 *    ```bash
 *    npm run analytics-from-file <path-to-pricing-file>
 *    ```
 * 
 * Replace `<path-to-pricing-file>` with the path to the pricing file to analyze.
 * 
 * 3. The results and errors will be logged in a timestamped folder located in the `logs` directory.
 * 
 * ------------ Example ------------
 * 
 *    ```bash
 *    npm run analytics-from-file ../data/pricings/yaml/TSC'25/microsoft365Business/2022.yml
 *    ```
 * 
 * In this example:
 * - The script processes `../data/pricings/yaml/TSC'25/microsoft365Business/2022.yml`.
 * - Analytics will be saved in `results.log`, and any errors will be saved in `errors.log` within a log folder 
 *   in the `logs` directory, named with the corresponding timestamp of the run.
